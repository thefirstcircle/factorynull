<p><em>Foreward: I have chosen to research another topic. Ultimately, this dataset does not lend itself to the network format for reasons I will describe below. I am including the original introduction for completeness.</em></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-the-semiconductor-supply-chain">Introduction: The Semiconductor Supply Chain<a class="anchorjs-link " aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" href="http://localhost:4142/#introduction-the-semiconductor-supply-chain" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>I’m interested in the nascent Taiwan-China conflict that could potentially take the world’s most important semiconductor manufacturing off the map and result in a dramatic chip shortage.</p>
<p>The dataset has some details about market share by country and company, and companies also include their national origin as vertex attributes.</p>
<p>For research questions, I am thinking along these lines:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What could happen in the event of a disruption to Taiwan (or anywhere in Asia’s) semiconductor manufacturing industry, and how would this affect alters?</li>
<li>Could alternative sources provide what Taiwan currently offers, i.e.&nbsp;are there structural holes or opportunities for brokerage? [Nodes here could be firms or countries.]</li>
<li>How do measures like betweenness and eigenvector centrality relate to the performance of firms, e.g.&nbsp;their market share?</li>
</ol>
<p>I am also interested in the U.S. CHIPS Act:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is the kind of component manufacturing suggested by this legislation meaningful in the scenario of US-China conflict, or sanctions and export controls? In other words, are we subsidizing the right kinds of manufacturing, or could this just be a flashy ‘pork’ project for certain legislators to have factories built in their home districts? For example, perhaps we are too focused on creating cutting-edge silicon wafers where we are really better off manufacturing simple mechanical parts.</li>
</ol>
<p>It might be interesting to generate an alternative version of the graph in which hypothetical sanctions and export controls are enacted against China, comparing that with the original graph.</p>
<p>As far as background reading, I have looked at <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-493X.2009.03166.x">“ON SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS IN A SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT”</a> which gives a pretty good background on theory. I’ll be thinking about its suggestions for nodes and ties found in its ‘CONCEPTS FOR SUPPLY NETWORKS’ section. As you can see from some of the early visualizations, I have <code>sequence</code> nodes mixed in with firm- and nation- nodes, so I am keen to separate them as appropriate.</p>
<p>Some other errata that I could capture in the project: - There are actually two components, one for the design and one for the fabrication of computer chips.</p>
<p>First, I will modify the <code>sequence</code> table so that <code>is_type_of_name</code> and <code>goes_into_name</code> are collapased into each other:</p>

RTP tools include lamps, lasers, or other mechanisms to quickly increase the temperature of a wafer in order to change its properties. For instance, RTP tools are used to activate materials (such as dopants in transistors) to change their properties, modify materials, or make deposited films denser to improve their properties. Some RTP tools provide heat for as long as multiple seconds (solely produced by the United States and South Korea); others provide it only for milliseconds (solely produced by the United States and Japan).","20":"$560 million (2019)","21":"NA","22":"[CSET](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/the-semiconductor-supply-chain/) (citing VLSI Research)"},{"1":"Applied Materials","2":"P81","3":"organization","4":"USA","5":"P81","6":"Electrochemical coating tools","7":"N45","8":"NA","9":"NA","10":"Electrochemical coating tools","11":"NA","12":"NA","13":"Deposition tools","14":"N36","15":"N45","16":"tool_resource","17":"NA","18":"NA","19":"Electrochemical coating tools use electrolysis to deposit materials.

To produce them, a furnace forms a cylinder of silicon (or other semiconducting materials), which is then cut into disc-shaped wafers. These wafers are then processed, split and packaged into individual chips. Most wafers are made purely of silicon or another material, but others have more complex structures.  Dopants, such as boron, aluminum, phosphorous, platinum or other elements, may be added to alter the level of semiconductivity.\\r\\n\\r\\n300 mm wafers, produced by Japanese, Taiwanese, German, and Korean firms, are used to produce nearly all advanced chips today.

<p>Consider the graph above, and how tasks, tools, and processes are intermixed. That will make it difficult to layer firms or countries onto the graph.</p>
<p>The <code>is_type_of_id</code> column is empty for things that are already categories, while raw inputs <em>do</em> have it. This means that the <code>type</code> column is misleading.</p>
<p>This code makes a partition between the two:</p>

<p>I want to keep the <code>sequence</code> data as inclusive as possible, so I will assign <code>goes_into_id</code> the value of <code>is_type_of_id</code> if it is null. This at least guarantees that there are edges between the relevant nodes, even if they are sub-categories:</p>

<p>It looks promising, but really this looks like a nearly fully connected graph. And a lot of manufacturers are missing! What gives?</p>

<p>The sad fact is that nearly all of the companies and countries in this dataset are among those ‘top’ level nodes. After two layers deep, the ‘edges’ I would rely on between between companies or countries start to be between things like ‘Process Control’ and ‘Chemical mechanical planarization’, and so on. That is why I only get 30-something nodes among companies while I should have hundreds.</p>
<p>If I got rid of the process nodes entirely and just kept the prime top-level nodes, I would get a very uninteresting network. Keep in mind that values in the <code>sequence</code> data were arbitrarily created by the <a href="https://eto.tech/dataset-docs/chipexplorer/">Emerging Technology Observatory</a> and do not reflect actual observations or physical constraints on companies:</p>
<p>I feel that my artisinal overlaying of countries and firms onto <code>sequence</code> is either outside of the scope of regular social network analysis, or not applicable at all. Things like structural holes, centrality, and network statistics would not apply, and I’m therefore skeptical of the project.</p>
<p>I would like to use my final examination to learn more about classical social network analysis, so I will (pending feedback) be changing to another topic, likely Congressional stock trading with data from the STOCKS Act.</p>
